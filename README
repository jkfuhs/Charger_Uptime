Compiling and Run instructions:
- To compile, run './Compile.sh'
- To run, run './Run.sh INPUT_TEXT_FILE.txt'

Considerations:
    Most invalid input files will return errors. However some input files
    may have inconsequential errors that will be ignored and be processed
    as normal. (such as extra whitespace)

    If an invalid input is detected but does not prohibit the program from running
    a message will print to stderr and the program will continue running as usual.
